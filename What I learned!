So far in this fundamentals file has really cracked down what I was able to understand while watching the informational videos on GitHub. The basic foundation on what Git and GitHub was pretty straightfoward and self-explanatory. Git is a version control software used by developers to save "snapshots" of their work to go over projects over time. This is best if used indidvudally. GitHub is what hosts Git and is used to collobarate as a team on projects with others where you can see their edits and changes in real time. 
What Im still a bit confused about is a pull request as it is what this assignemnt is asking me to do! Im not really understanding what the use of it is for and im struggling a bit.
